This week, I decided to use a midi library rather than write a full parser myself. I wrote the code to read midi track data and basic midi events, however I discovered that actual midi files have a ton of other events. If the files had nothing but basic midi events, my parser would be complete already! Using a library should allow me to spend more time working on the algorithm rather than just writing a midi parser. Plus, from what I wrote of a parser I've already learned more about midi than I ever need to know - all that's left of it is handling the 50 or so meta events/control events that are totally irrelevant to the project.
