This week, I added convenience features, fixed bugs, and did a bit of tidying up on the code, adding comments and handling exceptions. I also improved the use examples to show all the features, and made a midi file myself for use in the test file so I can actually upload it to the repo (before, I couldn't upload any of the midis I was using because I haven't got the rights). Also, the readme is improved.
