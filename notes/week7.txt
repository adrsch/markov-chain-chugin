This week, implementation of core features,with the exception of actual integration with chuck, was completed. That was looked into, and will be the task for the upcoming week. Perhaps that shouldve been worked out first, but I doubt anything will have to be rewritten. A bit added in, likely, but the core functionality that was done this week, at least, should be unchanged. A library called midifile was selected as the midi library to be used - it is pretty lightweight and seems to work well.
